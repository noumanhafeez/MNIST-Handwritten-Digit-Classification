# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classification

The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark dataset for handwritten digit classification. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of which is a 28x28 grayscale image of a handwritten digit from 0 to 9. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digits.

### Project Goals

The specific goals of this project are to:

Load and prepare the MNIST dataset

Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify handwritten digits

Train the CNN model on the MNIST dataset

Evaluate the performance of the CNN model on the test dataset

Save the trained CNN model

### Project Approach

The project will be implemented using the following steps:

Load the MNIST dataset from a public repository.

Prepare the MNIST dataset by normalizing the pixel values and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.

Build a CNN model using the Keras deep learning library.

Train the CNN model on the MNIST training dataset.

Evaluate the performance of the CNN model on the MNIST test dataset.

Save the trained CNN model.

### Project Deliverables

The deliverables of this project will be:

A Jupyter notebook containing the code for loading, preparing, training, and evaluating the CNN model.

A saved CNN model that can be used to classify handwritten digits.
